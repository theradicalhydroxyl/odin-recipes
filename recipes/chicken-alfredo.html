    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. 
            Add chicken; season with salt and pepper. Cook, 
            turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked 
            through, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer to a 
            cutting board. Let rest 10 minutes, then slice.</li>
        <li>In same skillet over medium heat, combine broth, 
            milk, and garlic; season with salt and pepper. 
            Bring to a simmer. Add fettuccine and cook, tossing 
            occasionally, until barely al dente, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in Parmesan and cream. Bring to a simmer and 
            cook, stirring frequently, until sauce thickens and 
            pasta is al dente, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in chicken. Top with parsley.</li>
